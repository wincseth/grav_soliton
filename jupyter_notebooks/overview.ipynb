    "# A summary of the numerical calculations for gravitational solitons and its results from incresingly relativistic parameters\n",

    "## Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers the computational methods and results for the project exploring how current interpretations of massive particles under its own quantum mechanical and gravitational influence behave with (ultra)relativistic parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The numerical calculations and theory interpret a particle both quantum mechanically and classically (aka with gravity), taking advantage of spherical symmetry. The particle's location is represented as a quantum mechanical mass distribution/wave function using the Klein-Gordon equation, which takes into account a spherically symmetric metric and is a relativistic representation of the Schrodinger equation. A scaled binding energy of $\\epsilon$ is extracted from that equation and is used to solved the metric equations for the particle, represented as two first order differential equations - one for time ($g_{00}$) and one for radius ($g_{rr}$). The resulting metrics are put back into the Klein-Gordon equation for an adjusted resulting $\\epsilon$ value and the process is repeated until it converges to a desirable tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main independent parameter being studied is the ratio of the Bohr radius ($a$) and Schwarchild radius ($r_s$), defined as $\\zeta_{s}={r_s}/a=2G^{2}m^{4}$. As this ratio approaches and passes 1, the relativistic self-gravitation of the particle becomes more important to consider as the wave function is altered by the curved metric."

    "## 1. Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Two sets of Python code were developed with the same functions in mind in order to verify and help troubleshoot the process - the code sets are similar in structure and methods from the collaborative nature of the project, where smaller differences are explained as needed. The functions used in data generation only involve the ``numpy`` library for data manipulation. All calculations are made with a rescaled unit system to ensure values are within floating point computer precision: $\\bar h=1$, $c=1$, $G=6.7 \\times 10^{-39} GeV^{-2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Current working scripts for data generation and analysis:\n",
    "1. ``grav_soliton/scripts/kg_and_metric_functions.py`` (Seth) and ``grav_soliton/scripts/X/Functions`` (Xavier): defines functions for the program between Klein-Gordon Solver, Metric ODEs, and iteration between them for a single $\\zeta_s$.\n",
    "2. ``grav_soliton/scripts/params_to_csv.py`` (Seth) and ``grav_soliton/scripts/X/Integrating_inside_out.py`` (Xavier): Imports the functions from (1) and iterates through $\\zeta_s$ values and generates the .csv data files.\n",
    "3. ``grav_soliton/scripts/csv_to_plot.py``: uses ``matplotlib`` to plot values of $\\epsilon$, $A_0$, $\\tilde R$, A, B, E/m, and $\\bar u$. Allows for multiple plot lines (for different $\\zeta_s$).\n",
    "4. ``grav_soliton/scripts/find_critical_zeta_s.py``: uses bisection method to approximate a critical $\\zeta_s$ value. takes the main iteration function in (1) and determines if a $\\zeta_s$ value is past the critical value by looking for NaN and overflow during intermediate steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "For data at a desired $\\zeta_s$ value, a set of grid points need to be made to perform calculations at, defined as $N$ intervals in a $\\zeta_{max}=r_{max}/a$ grid size, where the grid steps are $\\Delta = \\zeta_{max}/(N+1)$. The resulting algorithm flow is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generate initial data** by either reading existing data or using a fixed guess for the metric and wave function at nonrelativistic conditions ($\\zeta_s = 0$).\n",
    "2. Use values for the metric, expressed as $g_{00}=e^{2A}$ and $g_{rr}=e^{2B}$, as inputs for the **Klein-Gordon equation**. Then, solve the eigenvector-eigenvalue problem associated with the equation to get the **rescaled energy ($\\epsilon$) and modified radial wave function, defined as $\\bar u(\\zeta)$**.\n",
    "3. Use $\\epsilon$ and $\\bar u$ from the previous step to solve the two **ODEs that come from Einstein's equations**. **Solve for $A$ and $B$**, the exponential factors for the $g_{00}$ and $g_{rr}$ metric components.\n",
    "4. **Repeat (loop) steps 2 and 3** to get improved $\\epsilon$, $\\bar u$, $g_{00}$, and $g_{rr}$ values until $\\epsilon$ converges to a specified tolerance.\n",
    "5. Steps 2-4 apply for a single $\\zeta_s$ value; a $\\zeta_s$ value too far from 0 (>0.1) needs intermediate $\\zeta_s$ values to loop though so that the incoming approximations are not too far off for a non-converging algorithm. For example, if data at $\\zeta_s = 0.7$ is needed, step 1 will be done once for $\\zeta_s = 0$ and the results from step 4 will be used as inputs for step 2 (another loop), this time with a slightly higher $\\zeta_s$ like 0.05, and **$\\zeta_s$ will be incremented slightly (repeat steps 2-4)** until $\\zeta_s = 0.7$ is reached. The more intermediate steps of $\\zeta_s$ are taken, the more accurate the calculations become."
